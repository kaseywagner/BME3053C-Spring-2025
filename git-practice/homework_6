    ls, cat ./- (./ makes cat treat "-" as a filename instead of a symbol)

    ls, cat "spaces in this filename" (have to put "" around it since there are spaces it treats them as four different files)

    find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
    find — A command that searches for files and directories.
    / — The starting point for the search (root directory). This makes the search system-wide.
    -type f — Limits the search to files (not directories).
    -user bandit7 — Searches for files owned by the user bandit7.
    -group bandit6 — Searches for files that belong to the group bandit6.
    -size 33c — Finds files that are 33 bytes in size (the c stands for bytes).
    2>/dev/null — Suppresses error messages (like "Permission denied") by redirecting them to /dev/null.

    sort data.txt — The sort command organizes the contents of data.txt in lexicographical order.
    | — The pipe sends the sorted output to the next command.
    uniq -u — The uniq command filters out repeated lines and shows only unique lines (lines that appear exactly once). - because of -u
            it can also count (-c) or only return duplicate lines (-d).
