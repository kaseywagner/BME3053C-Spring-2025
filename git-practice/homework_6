    ls, cat ./- (./ makes cat treat "-" as a filename instead of a symbol)

3. MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
    ls, cat "spaces in this filename" (have to put "" around it since there are spaces it treats them as four different files)

4. 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
    ls, ls -a, cd inhere, cat ...Hiding-From-You
